# what_is_this_image
A function to check PIL image or np.ndarray attributes

When processing images in python (3): 
  > do you ever lose track of whether your image is a PIL.Image or np.ndarray?
  > do you ever lose track of track of its number of channels or range of values?
  > do you forget if its in BGR or RGB or what?
 
 If so, this is a little utility to help keep track of those things.
